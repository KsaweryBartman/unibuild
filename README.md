# unibuild
Universal build system for C and C++.

Uses it's own `unibuild.json` file as a build process description.
When releasing can convert to makefiles, cmakelists and build shell scripts.
Can be used as an alternative to any of the above during developement and as a way to provide multiple ways to build your software in a release.
